## Ending questions

### How long did it take you to complete this assignment?

6 hours

### What about this assignment did you find most challenging?

Sizing and positioning images in divs.

### What about this assignment did you find unclear?

I wasn't sure if the placeholder images were provided by me or if I had to implement "browse" functionality for users to use their own images.

### What challenges did you face that you did not expect?

Considering I've developed my own website I thought I would have finished this in 4 hours.

### Do you feel like this assignment has an appropriate level of difficulty?

Yes.

### Briefly explain your decisions to use tools, frameworks and libraries like React, Vue, etc.

I chose SvelteKit because I'm used to it. It has no virtual DOM and built-in routing as compared to frameworks likes React. I tried to use minimal tools and therefore used no additional packages.

### Did you make certain assumptions and decisions around the UI/UX? Please elaborate on your reasonings.

I started with a minimal UI with no styling. I planned to make it visually more appealing, but felt I ran out of time.
